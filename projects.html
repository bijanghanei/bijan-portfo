        <p class="project-description">
          Many young Iranians aspire to move to more developed countries by
          securing job offers, but finding the right opportunities can be
          challenging. To address this, I am developing a web scraping tool
          using Java, Spring Boot, and Jsoup to identify job postings offering
          visa sponsorship. This tool aims to simplify the process for
          immigrants, making it easier to find suitable positions.

        <h3>"GottaBuy"</h3>
        <p class="project-description">
          I always had the issue that I had many wish lists in different
          accounts on different websites, so I created a webapp that makes it
          possible to create different wish lists and add products from
          different places into a single account. Implemented secure
          authentication and authorization using Spring Security and JWT.

        <h3>"b-bot"</h3>
        <p class="project-description">
          In Iran, official currency exchange rates are not publicly disclosed,
          and the government restricts websites from sharing free market prices.
          To overcome this, I developed a Telegram bot using a microservice
          architecture. This bot connects to an API to provide real-time
          exchange rates against the Iranian Rial, allowing me to check live
          prices whenever needed.. (microservice architecture)

        <h3>"b-bank"</h3>
        <p class="project-description">
          During my internship at Barook, a payment solution company, I
          developed B-Bank, a microservices project. This project included a
          wallet service and a transaction service, which were connected
          synchronously.

        <h3>"encryption app"</h3>
        <p class="project-description">
          I’ve been curious about how encryption and decryption work in
          applications. Additionally, I had a specific need: I wanted to store
          data that only I could decrypt and fully understand. To address this,
          I developed a straightforward command-line application. With this app,
          you can generate an encryption key, input your text, and request it to
          be encrypted securely.
